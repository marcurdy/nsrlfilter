# nsrlfilter  
Wrapper to nsrlsearch for handling multiple whitelists/blacklists  
  
An NSRL whitelist is pretty simple to throw MD5's to.  You can run nsrlsearch with the servername. If you have additional
whitelists and blacklists running on other ports, you need a better client to consistently handle access.  Since DFIR is 
all about Python, let's do it.
