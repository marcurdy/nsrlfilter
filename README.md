# nsrlfilter  
Wrapper to nsrlsearch for handling multiple whitelists/blacklists  
  
A specific NSRL list is pretty simple to which to throw MD5's.  You can run nsrlsearch with the servername. If you have additional
lists to use as whitelists and blacklists running on other ports, you need a better client to consistently handle access.  Since DFIR is 
all about Python, let's do it.
